> A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system

- The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

## Conclusions
- Temp plays a major role in Bike demands , higher and optimal is the temp, bike demands are expected to grow
- the year 2019 has more bike demands than year 2018, hence we can predict more number of bikes need in upcoming year, as compared to previous year.
- the weather situation such as Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds , will impact the bike demands
